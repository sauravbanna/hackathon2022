# Lloyd's Laptops

This is an app that simplifies the process of finding a new laptop that meets your needs by condensing the process to a simple quiz. As the user answers questions about their ideal laptop specifications, the app narrows down choices from the database and displays the top choices to the user. Made for EUS x ece Hackathon 2022 at UBC.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by a recent experience by someone I knew who had to buy a new laptop, but was not that well versed in the components of a computer. They were confused by all the choices and options available, and so I decided to help make their choice easier.

## Features

- Dynamic UI that changes as the user answers questions
- Easy to understand questions and options that anyone can understand
- Weighting and sorting algorithm that takes into account each feature and its importance to the user
